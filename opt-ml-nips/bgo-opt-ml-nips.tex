\begin{abstract} 
For bandit convex optimization we propose a model, 
where a gradient estimation oracle acts as an intermediary between 
a noisy function evaluation oracle and the algorithms. 
The algorithms can control the bias-variance tradeoff in the gradient
estimates. We prove lower and upper bounds for the minimax
error of algorithms that interact with the objective function
by controlling this oracle. The upper bounds replicate many
existing results (capturing the essence of existing proofs)
while the lower bounds put a limit on the achievable performance
in this setup. In particular, our results imply that no algorithm 
can achieve the optimal minimax error rate in 
stochastic bandit smooth convex optimization.
