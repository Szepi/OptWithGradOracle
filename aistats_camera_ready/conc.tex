We presented a general noisy  gradient oracle for model for convex optimization. The oracle model covers several gradient estimation methods in the literature designed for algorithms that can observe only noisy function values, while allowing to handle explicitly the bias-variance tradeoff of these estimators. The framework allows to derive sharp upper and lower bounds on the minimax optimization error, reducing the optimization problem to study properties of gradient estimators.
