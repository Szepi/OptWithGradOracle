We presented a novel noisy  gradient oracle model for convex optimization. The oracle model covers several gradient estimation methods in the literature designed for algorithms that can observe only noisy function values, while allowing to handle explicitly the bias-variance tradeoff of these estimators. The framework allows to derive sharp upper and lower bounds on the minimax optimization error and the regret in the online case. From our lower bounds it follows that the current state of the art in designing and analyzing noisy gradient methods for stochastic and online smooth bandit convex optimization are suboptimal.
