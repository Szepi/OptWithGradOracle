\begin{abstract}
We present a novel noisy gradient oracle model for convex optimization. The model allows to explicitly address the bias-variance tradeoff of gradient estimation methods typical in the literature, as well as to prove upper and lower bounds for the minimax error. As such the oracle model allows a clean way of addressing the limits of achievable performance
when biased, noisy gradient estimators can be used with controllable bias-variance tradeoffs.
When considering the model for online/stochastic convex optimization,
one consequence of our results is that the currently used gradient estimates and the proof techniques used to analyze them cannot 
achieve the optimal square-root regret rate for online/stochastic bandit convex optimization.
% when the function cannot be queried outside the domain.
