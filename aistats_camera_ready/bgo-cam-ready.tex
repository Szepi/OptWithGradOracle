\vspace{-0.2cm}
Algorithms for bandit convex optimization and online learning often 
rely on constructing noisy gradient estimates, which are then used
 in appropriately adjusted first-order algorithms, replacing
 actual gradients.
Depending on the properties of the function to be optimized and the nature of ``noise'' in the bandit feedback,
the bias and variance of gradient estimates exhibit various tradeoffs.
% and, correspondingly,
%the algorithms were proven to achieve various convergence rates.
 In this paper we propose a novel framework that replaces the specific gradient estimation
 methods with an abstract oracle.
 % capturing the controlleable bias-variance tradeoff
 %of existing gradient estimators. 
 With the help of the new framework we unify previous works,
 reproducing  their results in a clean and concise fashion, 
 while, perhaps more importantly, the framework also allows us to formally show that to achieve the optimal 
  root-$n$ rate %in online/stochastic bandit convex optimization
  either the algorithms that use existing gradient estimators,
  or the proof techniques used to analyze them 
  have to go beyond what exists today.

We present a novel noisy gradient oracle model for convex optimization. The model allows to explicitly address the bias-variance tradeoff of gradient estimation methods typical in the literature, as well as to prove upper and lower bounds for the minimax error. As such the oracle model allows a clean way of addressing the limits of achievable performance
when biased, noisy gradient estimators with controllable bias-variance tradeoffs are employed.
When considering the model for online/stochastic convex optimization,
one consequence of our results is that the currently used gradient estimates and the proof techniques used to analyze them cannot 
achieve the optimal square-root regret rate for online/stochastic bandit convex optimization.
