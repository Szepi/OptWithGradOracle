In the \emph{online BCO} setting a learner sequentially chooses the points $X_1,\dots,X_n\in \cK$ while observing the losses $f_1(X_1),\dots,f_n(X_n)$. More specifically, in round $t$, having observed $f_1(X_1),\dots,f_{t-1}(X_{t-1})$ of the previous rounds, the learner chooses $X_t\in \cK$, after which it observes $f_t(X_t)$. The learner's goal is to minimize its expected regret $\EE{ \sum_{t=1}^n f_t(X_t) - \inf_{x\in \cK} \sum_{t=1}^n f_t(x) }$. 
This problem is also called online convex optimization with one-point feedback.
A slightly different problem is obtained if we allow the learner to choose multiple points in every round, at which points the function $f_t$ is observed. The loss is suffered at $X_t$. The points where the function is observed (``observation points'' for short) may or may not be tied to $X_t$. One possibility is that $X_t$ is one of the observation points.  
Another possibility is that $X_t$ is the average of the observation points (e.g., \citet{AgDeXi10}). Yet another possibility is that there is no relationship between them. 

The oracle constructions from the previous section also apply to the online BCO setting
where the algorithm is evaluated at $Y_t$, though in this case 
one cannot employ two-point feedback as the functions change between rounds. 
This also rules out the controlled noise case. 
Thus, for the online BCO setting, one should consider type-I (and II) oracles with $c_1(\delta) = C_1 \delta^p$ and $c_2(\delta) = C_2\delta^{-q}$ with $p=q=2$.
For these type of oracles, the results from \cref{thm:lb-convex} give the following result: 
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:aaa}
Let $\cF_{L,0}$ be the space of convex, $L$-smooth functions over a convex body $\K$.
No algorithm that relies on 
 $(\delta^2,\delta^{-2})$ type-I oracles
 can achieve better regret than $\Omega(n^{2/3})$.
\end{theorem}

With a noisy gradient oracle of \cref{prop:flaxman}, \cref{thm:aaa} implies that this regret rate is achievable, essentially recovering, and in some sense proving optimality of the result of \citet{saha2011improved}:
\begin{theorem}
For zeroth order noisy optimization with smooth convex functions, the gradient estimator of \cref{prop:flaxman} together with mirror descent (see \cref{alg}) achieve $\O(n^{2/3})$ regret.
\end{theorem}

This ``optimality result'' shows that with the usual analysis of the current gradient estimation techniques, no gradient method can achieve the optimal regret $O(n^{1/2})$ for online bandit convex optimization, established by \citet{BubeckDKP15,BuEl15}. Note that \cref{thm:aaa} contradicts the recent results of \citet{DeElKo15,YaMo16}, who claimed to achieve $\tilde{O}(n^{5/8})$ and, resp., $\tilde{O}(n^{8/13})$ regret with the same $(\delta^2,\delta^{-2})$ type-II gradient oracle as \citet{saha2011improved}, but their proof only used the $(\delta^2,\delta^{-2})$ tradeoff in the bias and variance properties of the oracle.\todoa{Actually, all these proofs use Type-IIb oracles....}
A thorough inspection of their proofs reveals that Lemma~11 of \citet{DeElKo15} and Lemma~6 of \citet{YaMo16} is incorrect.%
\footnote{Using the notation of \citet{DeElKo15}, in Lemma~11 they used the equation $\E[\hat{g}_{t-i}^T(x_{t-i} - x_t)] = \E[\nabla \hat{f}_{t-i} (x_{t-i})^T(x_{t-i} - x_t)]$, where $\hat{g}_{t-i}$ is the estimated gradient at time $t-i$, $x_t$ is the prediction of their algorithm at time $t$, and $\hat{f}_t$ is an approximate loss function at time t. Since $x_t$ depends on the randomness at time $t-i$, although $\E[\hat{g}_{t-i}] = \nabla \hat{f}_{t-i} (x_{t-i})$, the previous equality does not hold. A similar mistake also appears in Lemma~6 of \citet{YaMo16} (the error is in the last displayed equation in the proof of the lemma). These mistakes mask a bias term, which, if taken into account properly, leads to an $O(n^{2/3})$ regret, in agreement with our lower bound.}
Our attempts to correct their proofs lead to $O(n^{2/3})$ regret, in agreement with our lower bound presented in \cref{thm:aaa}.
