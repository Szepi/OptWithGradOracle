Bandit convex optimization:

Online adversarial setting. Optimal rate is $\Theta(\sqrt{T})$.
No one knows general practical algorithms achieving this rate.
Strongly convex + smooth: \cite{hazan2014bandit}

Stochastic optimization setting: ??? Shamir's paper \cite{shamir2012complexity}??
Lower bounds, upper bounds for the general case?
\cite{hazan2014bandit} for upper bound.

All kind of papers about how to estimate gradients going back to maybe 70s in Russia.

One-point: \cite{flaxman2005online}

Two-point: \cite{AgDeXi10}
\cite{duchi2013optimal}

Lower bds: \cite{raginsky2011information} \cite{Chen88:LB-AoS}
