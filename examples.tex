Explain SPSA, Flaxman gradient estimation (give refs).
Add others.

Proposition: SPSA is $(c_1,c_2)$ Type-I oracle when $\cF$ contains only $3$-times continuously differentiable functions where  $c_1 = \cdot$, $c_2 = \dots$. \todoc{Make this precise, add proof.}

Proposition:  Flaxman is $(c_1,c_2)$ Type-II oracle when $\dots$. \todoc{Expand}

\todoc[inline]{To add: One-point, two-point feedback, equivalence in optimization.}

\todoc[inline]{To consider: Different regularity conditions on $\cF$.}
