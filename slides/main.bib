	Abstract = {We propose a general class of randomized gradient estimates to be employed in a recursive search for the minimum of an unknown multivariate regression function. Here only two observations per iteration step are used. Special cases include random direction stochastic approximation (Kushner and Clark), simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (Spall) and a special kernel based stochastic approximation method (Polyak and Tsybakov). If the unknown regression is p-smooth (p ≥ 2) at the point of minimum, these methods achieve the optimal rate of convergence O(n-(p-1)/(2p)). For both the classical stochastic approximation scheme (Kiefer and Wolfowitz) and the averaging scheme (Ruppert and Polyak) the related asymptotic distributions are computed.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we prove the complexity bounds for methods of Convex Optimization based only on computation of the function value. The search directions of our schemes are normally distributed random Gaussian vectors. It appears that such methods usually need at most n times more iterations than the standard gradient methods, where n is the dimension of the space of variables. This conclusion is true both for nonsmooth and smooth problems. For the later class, we present also an accelerated scheme with the expected rate of convergence O(n[ exp ]2 /k[ exp ]2), where k is the iteration counter. For Stochastic Optimization, we propose a zero-order scheme and justify its expected rate of convergence O(n/k[ exp ]1/2). We give also some bounds for the rate of convergence of the random gradient-free methods to stationary points of nonconvex functions, both for smooth and nonsmooth cases. Our theoretical results are supported by preliminary computational experiments.},
